docker-compose up --build -d
*Wait a moment for all services (postgres, redis, minio, backend, ai_service) to start.*

#### **Step 3: Database Migration Setup (Alembic)**

You need the `alembic` folder and the migration script to create the `users` table.

1.  **Initialize Alembic:** If you haven't run this, it creates the `backend/alembic` folder structure.
    ```bash
    docker exec -it mindlink-backend-1 alembic init -t async backend/alembic
    2.  **Generate Migration Script:** This inspects `user_model.py` and creates the SQL statements.
    ```bash
    docker exec -it mindlink-backend-1 alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial user setup"
    3.  **Apply Migration (Execute SQL):** This creates the `users` table in your PostgreSQL database.
    ```bash
    docker exec -it mindlink-backend-1 alembic upgrade head
        *You should see output indicating the table was created.*

#### **Step 4: Test Authentication Endpoints**

The FastAPI backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`. You can test the endpoints using a tool like Postman or the interactive **Swagger UI**.

1.  **Access Swagger UI:** Open your web browser and navigate to:
    `http://localhost:8000/docs`

2.  **Test Registration (POST /api/auth/register):**
    * Find the **`/api/auth/register`** endpoint in Swagger UI.
    * Click "Try it out."
    * Enter the Request Body (e.g.):
        ```json
        {
          "name": "Test User",
          "email": "test@mindlink.com",
          "password": "password123"
        }
            * Click "Execute."
    * **Expected Result:** A **201 Created** status and a response body containing the **`access_token`** and the user's profile data. This confirms hashing and database storage worked.

3.  **Test Login (POST /api/auth/login):**
    * Find the **`/api/auth/login`** endpoint.
    * Click "Try it out."
    * Enter the Request Body (e.g.):
        ```json
        {
          "email": "test@mindlink.com",
          "password": "password123"
        }
            * Click "Execute."
    * **Expected Result:** A **200 OK** status and a new **`access_token`**. This confirms password verification worked.

#### **Step 5: Verify AI Service (Health Check)**

Although the AI service doesn't have a public API yet, you can ensure the container is running by checking its logs:

```bash
docker logs mindlink-ai_service-1
* **Expected Output:** You should see output from the `ingest.py` script, likely mentioning "Ingestion worker started successfully. Waiting for tasks..." (or errors if it couldn't connect to MinIO/S3, which is expected since we haven't tested S3 yet).

If all authentication tests pass, your **Backend MVP (Milestone 1)** is complete, and the database is connected! The next phase is integrating the **Frontend**.
